<p>They're Pinky and the Brain</br>
Yes, Pinky and the Brain</br>
One is a genius, the other's other insane</br>
They're laboratory mice</br>
Their genes have been spliced</br>
They're Pinky, they're Pinky and the Brain</br>
Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain</br></br>
Before each night is done</br>
Their plan will be unfurled</br>
By the dawning of the sun</br>
They'll take over the world</br></br>
Before each night is done</br>
Their plan will be unfurled</br>
By the dawning of the sun</br>
They'll take over the world</br>
They're Pinky and the Brain</br>
Yes, Pinky and the Brain</br>
Their twilight campaign is easy to explain</br>
To prove their mousy worth</br>
They'll overthrow the earth</br>
They're Pinky, they're Pinky and the Brain</br>
Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, narf</p>
